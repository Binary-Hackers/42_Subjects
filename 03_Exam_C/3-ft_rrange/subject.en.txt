Write the following function:

int     *ft_rrange(int start, int end);

It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
values that begin at end and end at start (Including start and end !), then
return a pointer to the first value of the array.

Examples:

- With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 3, 2 and 1
- With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing 2, 1, 0 and -1.
- With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
- With (0, -3) you will return an array containing -3, -2, -1 and 0.
